**TODO:** Define helpers to enumerate site layouts defined in ``sitelayout``
resource directories.

**TODO:** Define mechanism for restricting site layouts in the page FTI

As a content author, I can change the site layout applied to the section underneath my page
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Flow:

    #. User edits an existing page
    #. User clicks button to change site layout for pages in the current section
    #. Settings are saved with the page

Components:

    * ``sectionLayout`` attribute of ``ILayout`` behaviour
    * ``getPageSiteLayout()`` in ``plone.app.page.utils``

**TODO:** Define helper to enumerate available site layouts

As an administrator, I can edit the site layout and insert tiles
----------------------------------------------------------------

Flow:

    #. Administrator goes to layouts control panel
    #. Administrator selects from list of currently available site layouts
    #. Administrator edits grid and inserts tiles in the same way as a page is edited
        * A layout currently on the filesystem is copied to the ZODB

Components:

    * ``plone.resource`` type for ``sitelayout``
    * In-ZODB sitelayout resource directory

As an administrator, I can designate panels in the site layout usually occupied by content
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Flow:

    #. Administrator creates a site layout grid with relevant tiles, including
        placeholders where content is meant to be shown
    #. Administrator selects a grid cell and clicks the "placeholder" button
    #. An overlay appears allowing the administrator to give the placeholder a name
        * Note: Exactly one panel must have the name "content"
    #. Deco adds the relevant markup to designate this grid cell a panel

**TODO:** Ensure we can both insert multiple text/app/field tiles in the
placeholder panel and effectively mark the region.

As an administrator, I can create new categories, associated with a default layout and a default set of behaviours
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Flow:

    #. Administrator goes to the types/categories control panel
    #. Administrator selects an existing category (e.g. "Page", the default),
        and clicks "Clone"
    #. An overlay appears asking for a new name and description
    #. A new category is created with values copied from the original
    #. Administrator can now edit properties (e.g. icon, child object
        filtering, default site layout, template page layout)

Components:

    * ``clonePageType()`` in ``plone.app.page.utils``

**TODO:** Do we want to allow the administrator to create new template layouts
"on the fly"?

As a content author, I can apply a behaviour to a page
------------------------------------------------------

Flow:

    #. User edits a page
    #. User clicks "apply behaviour"
    #. An overlay appears, giving the user a choice of behaviours with title
       and description
    #. User selects the relevant behaviour
        * Behaviour is allowed immediately
        * If the behaviour applies new fields, these become available as field
          tiles

Components:

    * Helpers in ``plone.behavior`` (see ``plone.app.dexterity`` for examples)

**TODO:** Need to create per-item behaviour adapter; store list of behaviours
in an attribute (list of strings - no direct interface references)

As a content author, I can insert fields provided by a behaviour as field tiles
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

No special flow, but need to make sure we can deal with behaviours being added
or removed during an editing session

As an administrator, I can download layouts and categories to an archive
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Flow:

    #. Administrator goes to layouts control panel
    #. Administrator chooses one or more layouts
    #. Administrator clicks "export" and is given a zip file to download

Components:

    * ``plone.resource`` resource directories' ``exportZip()`` method
    * See ``plone.app.theming`` for example code
    
**TODO:** Is a resource directory the correct abstraction here? This implies
we are working on a set of related layouts. Perhaps we need the UI to reflect
this so layouts are always created in (and can be moved between) resource
directories, which are the units of export/import.

As a site administrator, I can deploy layouts and categories from an archive, without needing filesystem access
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Flow:

    #. Administrator goes to layouts control panel
    #. Administrator chooses to import layouts form a zip file
    #. Administrator chooses a file and clicks upload
    #. New layouts are made available

Components:

    * ``plone.resource`` resource directories' ``importZip()`` method
    * See ``plone.app.theming`` for example code

**TODO:** Define manifest format

As a site administrator, I can deploy layouts and categories from an archive as part of an automated build process
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Flow:

    #. Administrator places an unpackaged equivalent of the resource archive
       in the global resource directory on the filesystem
    #. Resources are available after a server restart

Components:

    * ``plone.resource`` resource directories

As an administrator, I can apply a Diazo theme and still allow content editors to use Deco layouting in specific regions
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

No special flow, but this has implications over how we package up the JS
and CSS that enables Deco.

As a content author, I can translate a page
-------------------------------------------

**TODO**

Design decisions
================

Where do we store site layouts?
-------------------------------

Site layouts are stored in resource directories of type ``sitelayout``. The
default site layout that ships with ``plone.app.deco`` is
``++sitelayout++default/site.html``.

The ``sitelayout`` traverser is registered in ``plone.app.page``.

By convention, the site layout is in a file ``site.html``. Metadata can be
supplied in an optional ``manifest.cfg`` inside the site layout directory,
which should have this format::

    [sitelayout]
    title = A short title
    description = A slightly longer description
    file = site.html

All keys are optional. The ``file`` parameter gives the name of a file inside
this resource directory.

Like a Diazo theme deployed with plone.app.theming, the site layout may
reference images, stylesheets etc with relative links. These will be rewritten
as absolute paths, on the assumption that they are contained within the
resource directory.

How do we reference site layouts from pages and templates?
----------------------------------------------------------

A site layout is embedded in a page layout with a link like::

    <link rel="layout" href="./@@page-site-layout" />

or::

    <link rel="layout" href="./@@default-site-layout" />

These two helper views look up the current site layout to use. The former can
be used for the view of a page, where the site layout may be overridden on
a per-page basis. The latter is more applicable to a standalone view such as
a control panel form. The site layout may be stored:

* On a page, in the ``ILayout`` behaviour's ``pageSiteLayout`` property
* On a parent page/section, in the ``ILayout`` behaviour's ``sectionLayout``
  property
* On the page FTI, in the ``default_site_layout``
* In the registry (the global default) under the key
  ``plone.defaultSiteLayout``

Where do we store saved template page layouts?
----------------------------------------------

Template page layouts are used as the default value for the ``content`` field
in the ``ILayout`` behaviour - in other words, they are the default content
in the Deco editor.

Template page layouts are stored in resource directories of type
``pagelayout``. The default template page layout that ships with
``plone.app.deco`` is ``++pagelayout++default/page.html``.

The ``pagelayout`` traverser is registered in ``plone.app.page``.

By convention, the site layout is in a file ``page.html``. Metadata can be
supplied in an optional ``manifest.cfg`` inside the site layout directory,
which should have this format::

    [pagelayout]
    title = A short title
    description = A slightly longer description
    file = site.html

All keys are optional. The ``file`` parameter gives the name of a file inside
this resource directory.

Like a Diazo theme deployed with plone.app.theming, a page layout may
reference images, stylesheets etc with relative links. These will be rewritten
as absolute paths, on the assumption that they are contained within the
resource directory.

Where do we store categories?
-----------------------------

Categories are stored as FTIs in ``portal_types``, using the ``IPageFTI``
interface. This is an extension of ``IDexterityFTI``, which is more
opinionated and stores a few more options: 

``default_site_layout``
    The default site layout to use when creating pages in this category.
    Note that this can be overridden on a per-section basis through the
    ``sectionLayout`` property of the ``ILayout`` behaviour, which controls
    the default site layout for pages in a given section.

``default_page_layout_template``
    The default page template layout for pages in this category.

The ``PageFTI`` type and related helper methods for managing categories are
found in the ``plone.app.page`` package.

How do we export/import site layouts, template page layouts, and categories
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Site layouts
    Use ``plone.resource`` to package and deploy resources and manifest files.
Template page layouts
    Use ``plone.resource`` to package and deploy resources and manifest files.
Categories
    Use GenericSetup (``types.xml`` and relates XML files)

How do we manage per-category behaviours?
-----------------------------------------

Since categories are just instantiations of a Dexterity FTI, this is managed
on the FTI as normal.

How do we manage per-page behaviours?
-------------------------------------

Per-page behaviours can be enabled through a custom ``IBehaviorAssignable``
adapter. Per-page and per-category behaviours should be additive.

**TODO:** Add support for per-page behaviours.

How do we allow users to "take over" panels (or tiles?) from the site layout
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

By default, the site layout contains a panel ``content``, which is filled by
the default page layout.

The user can switch site layouts to obtain a bigger ``content`` panel, e.g.
to take over left/right hand side.

Other panels may be included, in which case Deco may allow the user
to replace them in the page layout. This starts with copying the site layout
tiles into the page layout, before making them editable. (Before taking over a
panel, the site layout's tiles will be shown in the editor, but not editable.)

Each panel lives inside a Deco Grid cell. Each panel then contains a nested
grid of its own. There is only one such level of nesting.

The site layout may contain other tiles inside other grid cells that are not
marked as panels. These are never editable.

Where do we store binary data (images, files) for tiles
-------------------------------------------------------

For now, we will only allow transient tiles to be added to the site layout.
The out-of-the-box tiles should all be transient.

Note that tiles may reference binary data, either in the ZODB or in a
resource directory.

**TODO:** Ensure this works with files in ``plone.resource`` directory.

Persistent tiles may be added to pages. Their data will be stored in
annotations.

How do we control 'can edit layout' permissions? 
------------------------------------------------

This is enforced in Deco by observing a permission. It is enforced at the UI
level only, i.e. not on the server side.

**TODO:** Define permission.

How do tiles interact with translations?
----------------------------------------

**TODO**

Packages
========

The following packages participate in the Deco/Blocks layout engine:

``plone.app.blocks``
    Implements the Blocks rendering algorithm as a ``plone.transformchain``
    post-processing step.
``plone.app.page``
    Defines a page content type using Dexterity, the ``PageFTI`` and the
    ``ILayout`` behaviour. Also defines the page and site layout traversers.
``plone.tiles`` and ``plone.app.tiles``
    Defines the API for creating tiles.
``plone.app.standardtiles``
    Contains standard Plone tiles.
``plone.app.deco``
    Depends on all of the above, configuring them in the site. Also contains
    the Deco editor GUI.
